<h1><b>UF 3rd Annual Datafest</b></h1>

<t>We analyzed business data (leases, unemployment, major market occupation and price and availability) to determine 
shifts in trends since COVID in relation to where businesses choose to build their headquarters. </t>
<h3>State Analysis Folder</h3>
-> File for each state showing the # of leases each year in CBD (central business disctrict) V suburban areas
<h3>State Data Folder</h3>
-> Each file contains a lease in that state (address, city, direction (E/W)) and information about the location (CBD v suburban)

<h3>Python</h3>
-> Used python to write a SQL script to clean data and seperate by state
-> Aggregating the tables was done once exported to excel

<br>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>We wanted to determine whether businesses were moving away from city centers as a result of cost and remote workers,
and instead choosing to locate in surburban areas.</p>
<i>Some cities seemed to follow that trend, while others were inconclusive.</i>
